# Flappy Bird Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm for the Flappy Bird game. The following files are included:

## Files Description

1. `agent.py`: This file contains the implementation of the reinforcement learning agent. It includes the logic for interacting with the environment, selecting actions, updating the model, and learning from the rewards received.

2. `flappy_game.py`: This file implements the Flappy Bird game environment. It defines the game mechanics, such as the movement of the bird, the generation of pipes, and the collision detection.

3. `models.py`: In this file, you can find the definition of the neural network models used in your reinforcement learning algorithm. It includes the architecture, layers, and parameters of the models.

4. `pre_processing.py`: This file contains code for preprocessing the input data or observations before feeding them into the neural network. It may include tasks like resizing images, converting data formats, or scaling values.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the dependencies and libraries required to run your project. It ensures that anyone who wants to use your code can easily install the necessary packages.

6. `test_model.py`: This file provides code for testing the trained models. It includes functions for evaluating the performance of the reinforcement learning agent on a trained model using various metrics or visualizations.

7. `train.py`: This file contains the code for training the reinforcement learning agent. It includes the main training loop, hyperparameter settings, and logic for updating the model based on the rewards received.

## Usage

To use this reinforcement learning algorithm and train an agent for the Flappy Bird game, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. Adjust any necessary hyperparameters or settings in the `train.py` file to suit your needs.

3. Run the training script `train.py` to start the training process:

```python train.py```

4. Monitor the training progress, and after training, the trained models will be saved for future use.

5. To test the trained model, you can use the `test_model.py` file:

```python test_model.py```
